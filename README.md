# 5291 Capstone Project

# Forecasting Bitcoin Price via Stock-to-Flow and Machine Learning Models

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that operate on blockchain technology and share certain characteristics with stock markets. Bitcoin, one of the earliest cryptocurrencies, remains highly volatile and unstable. The purpose of this project is to forecast Bitcoin prices by analyzing a ten-year time series dataset of daily Bitcoin prices and transaction volumes. To achieve this, we will apply several approaches: regression models to assess the influence of the stock-to-flow ratio in a regression context, and various deep learning approaches to establish a long-term trend measurement system for Bitcoin price estimation.
